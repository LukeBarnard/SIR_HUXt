# SIR HUXt - Sequential Importance Resampling with HUXt.

## Introduction
SIR HUXt integrates Sequential Importance Resampling (a class of Particle Filter Data Assimilation) into the HUXt solar wind model.

This is used to show how synthetic observations of the CME flank elongation can be used to constrain the modelled CME evolution.

## Installation
This project is written in Python 3.7.3
