# SIR HUXt - Sequential Importance Resampling with HUXt.

## Introduction
SIR HUXt integrates Sequential Importance Resampling (a class of Particle Filter Data Assimilation) into the HUXt solar wind model.

We develop a set of Observing System Simulation Experiments to study the effectiveness of assimilating the observed CME flank elongation into HUXt to better constrain the evolution of a CME.

## Installation
This project is written in Python 3.7.3
